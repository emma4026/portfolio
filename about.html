  <h2>Relection</h2>
<p/>06/21/17: This week we started working with robots<br>and arduino. I really enjoy robotics and working with new languages<br>
  I do however perfer to work alone, and this is something I need to work on. Building<br>things makes me happy, and can take<br>
  me to another world all alone.</p>
<p>06/22/17: Today we worked on getting our robots to navigate around<br>a maze. 
My group got stuck with a faulty robot, the whisker<br>wires always fell off. We eventually kinda
  got it working, well working<br>enought for it to move and kinda get around correctly.
  It definetly<br>was hard for me to not take control of everything and do it all my way and by my-self.<br>
  Though working with a team of awesome people is making it<br>a little easier to work together as one.</p>
<p>06/23/17: Today we are working a little with JavaScript, and<br>incorperating that into our portfolio websites. We are also going<br>
  Emory University to hear some people talk,<br>(not the medical side though..).My favorite part about today so far is that we get to work<br>
  on our websites and create cool features.</p>
<p>06/26/17: Today we started working more with JavaScript<br>and creating new features for our websites.<br>In the 
morning we acted out little skits<br>that show how the internet works. I would deffinetly<br>say that in the morning 
we mostly did group work, when the<br>afternoon was more independent. Also a few<br>days ago my L key fell off and now its really<br>
    annoying to type an L.</p>
