<h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>
<p stlye="text-align:center;">My name is Emma Jackson and I am 17 years old.<br>
Life outside of school consists<br>of working on robots and crafting my heart out.</p>
<p>Robotics takes up most of my time between the end of January<br>and the end of april.</p>

<h2>Relection</h2
<p>06/22/17: Today we worked on getting our robots to navigate around<br>a maze. 
My group got stuck with a faulty robot, the whisker<br>wires always fell off. We eventually kinda
  got it working, well working<br>enought for it to move and kinda get around correctly.
  It definetly<br>was hard for me to not take control of everything and do it all my way and by my-self.<br>
  Though working with a team of awesome people is making it<br>a little easier to work together as one.</p>
